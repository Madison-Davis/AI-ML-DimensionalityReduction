# Dimensionality Reduction
# Part 1: PCA Reduction on Country Data
See code for implementation.  More details shown below:</br>
Deduce groupings of countries based on geo, social, and economic features.  48 Components were examined in total, and 2 Components appeared to produce the best clusters of countries.
Full dataset can be found on Kaggle.  ~100 countries were taken off due to partially missing data points.

# Part 2: QDA Reduction on Refrain Prediction
See code for implementation.  More details shown below:</br>
Miniature project designed to determine music genre prediction based on characteristics of the song.

The Dimensionality Reduction algorithm "Quadratic Discriminant Analysis" (QDA) was utilized for this approach.
